# FoundryVTT Module

Playlist Enhancer allows you to create playlists from the current playing tracks. Curate your sounds and atmosphere and click the "Curate" button to create a playlist containing those sounds and their properties. Also adds support for drag & dropping copies of songs between playlists to make sound management a breeze.

All track settings (Volume, fade etc.) are accurately saved within the new playlist when curating playlists or moving songs.
